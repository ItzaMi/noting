# Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to **Noting**

**Noting** is an easy-to-use app for you to take notes on your browser without absolutely no hassle! It keeps your info on _local storage_ and uses Markdown so you can create your notes with your personal flare to them.

If this is your first time using Markdown, check out [this guide](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). It will teach you everything you need to know about it!

## About **Noting**

**Noting** appeared as a ReactJS side project that slowly took shape into a full-fledged working app and here it is. While it's not complex, I believe it offers and delivers everything you may want on a straightforward note taking app.

**Noting** allows you to create, edit and delete apps and offers you a **Dark Mode** so you can keep working on late hours! (_isn't that great?_ ðŸ˜ƒ)

**Noting** keeps your info on _local storage_ so be aware that any information losses will only be your fault! (Keeping a database secure would be too much work at the moment but I may think about implementing it!)

### What was used to build it

**Noting** was built using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with styling provided by [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). The markdown editor used was [@uiw/react-md-edit](https://github.com/uiwjs/react-md-editor).
